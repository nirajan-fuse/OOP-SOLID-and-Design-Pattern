# [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)] Download the python file from this link. In this file, there is an implementation of a 
# banking system for account handling. There is a savings account and a checking account class. The checking account inherits 
# the savings account as both have the same functionality and the checking account allows overdrafts (allow processing 
# transactions even if there is not sufficient balance). Redesign this program to follow the  Liskov Substitution Principle 
# (LSP) principle which represents that “objects should be replaceable by their subtypes without altering how the program 
# works”.
